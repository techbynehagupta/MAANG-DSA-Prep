# Problem Statement:
    Given an array arr of n integers, where arr[i] represents price of the stock on the ith day. Determine the maximum profit achievable by buying and selling the stock at most once. 
    The stock should be purchased before selling it, and both actions cannot occur on the same day.


Example 1

    Input: arr = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]

    Output: 6

    Explanation: Buy on day 3 (price = 5) and sell on day 5 (price = 11), profit = 11 - 5 = 6.

Example 2

    Input: arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

    Output: 0

    Explanation: In this case, no transactions are made. Therefore, the maximum profit remains 0.

# Constraints

    1 <= n<= 105
    0 <= arr[i] <= 106
*/


/*
# Intuition
1. finds the maximum profit from one buy and one sell transaction by tracking:

        buy → the minimum stock price seen so far
        profit → the maximum profit possible till current day
Ex- arr = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]

What the Algorithm Thinks

    At every day:

    "Can I get better profit if I sell today?"

# Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity
    O(n) because the algorithm iterates through the array of size n exactly once using a single loop starting from index 1 to n-1.

Space Complexity
    O(1) because the algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space for the variables 'buy' and 'profit', regardless of the input size.
